Certainly! Below is a comprehensive README.md file with detailed instructions on how to use your Magento 2 extension, including admin configurations and usage guidelines:

# Ssquare Github Module

Ssquare Github Module is a Magento 2 extension that allows you to deploy changes to a GitHub repository directly from the Magento admin panel using Git commands.

## Installation

### Composer Installation

You can install the module via Composer. Run the following command in your Magento 2 root directory:

```bash
composer require ssquare/module-github
```

### Manual Installation

Alternatively, you can manually install the module by downloading the source code and placing it in the `app/code/Ssquare/Github` directory of your Magento 2 installation.

After installing the module, enable it by running the following command:

```bash
php bin/magento module:enable Ssquare_Github
php bin/magento setup:upgrade
```

## Configuration

1. Navigate to **Stores > Configuration > Ssquare > Github Settings** in the Magento admin panel.

2. Enter your GitHub access token in the **GitHub Access Token** field. You can generate a new access token in your GitHub account settings with the required permissions.

3. Enter the URL of your GitHub repository in the **GitHub Repository URL** field.

4. Click on **Save Config**.

## Usage

### Deploying Changes

To deploy changes to your GitHub repository, use the following command:

```bash
php bin/magento git:deploy <branch_name> "<commit_message>"
```

Replace `<branch_name>` with the name of the branch you want to deploy changes to, and `<commit_message>` with the commit message for the changes.

If you specify the branch name as `head`, the command will use `HEAD` to refer to the currently checked-out branch.

If the specified branch does not exist on the remote repository, the command will create a new branch and push changes to it.

### Admin Configuration

You can configure the GitHub access token and repository URL in the Magento admin panel under **Stores > Configuration > Ssquare > Github Settings**.

## How to optain Github Secret Token


Feel free to customize this README.md file further to include any additional information specific to your module or installation instructions.

To create a GitHub personal access token (sometimes referred to as "classic token") for your Magento 2 module, follow these steps:

Sign in to GitHub: Go to GitHub and sign in to your GitHub account.

Access Personal Access Tokens Settings:

Click on your profile icon at the top right corner of the page.
From the dropdown menu, select "Settings".
Navigate to Developer Settings:

In the left sidebar, scroll down and click on "Developer settings".
Access Personal Access Tokens Page:

In the Developer settings page, click on "Personal access tokens".
Generate a New Token:

Click on the "Generate new token" button.
Configure Token:

Enter a descriptive name for your token in the "Note" field. This helps you identify the token's purpose later.
Select the scopes (permissions) for your token. For your Magento 2 extension, you'll likely need at least the repo scope to access repositories.
Optionally, you can also select additional scopes based on your requirements.
Generate Token:

Once you've configured the token settings, click on the "Generate token" button.
Copy Token:

GitHub will generate a new personal access token. Make sure to copy the token immediately, as it won't be shown again.
Save Token Securely:

Store the token securely in a safe location. Treat it like a password, as it provides access to your GitHub account and repositories.
Use Token:

In your Magento 2 module, use this personal access token when configuring the GitHub settings to enable the deployment functionality.
