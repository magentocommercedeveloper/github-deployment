# Ssquare Github Module

Ssquare Github Module is a Magento 2 extension that allows you to deploy changes to a GitHub repository directly from the Magento admin panel using Git commands.

## Installation

### Composer Installation

You can install the module via Composer. Run the following command in your Magento 2 root directory:

```bash
composer require ssquare/module-github
```

### Manual Installation

Alternatively, you can manually install the module by downloading the source code and placing it in the `app/code/Ssquare/Github` directory of your Magento 2 installation.

After installing the module, enable it by running the following command:

```bash
php bin/magento module:enable Ssquare_Github
php bin/magento setup:upgrade
```

## Configuration

1. Navigate to **Stores > Configuration > Ssquare > Github Settings** in the Magento admin panel.

2. Enter your GitHub access token in the **GitHub Access Token** field. You can generate a new access token in your GitHub account settings with the required permissions.

3. Enter the URL of your GitHub repository in the **GitHub Repository URL** field.

4. Click on **Save Config**.

## Usage

### Deploying Changes

To deploy changes to your GitHub repository, use the following command:

```bash
php bin/magento git:deploy <branch_name> "<commit_message>"
```

Replace `<branch_name>` with the name of the branch you want to deploy changes to, and `<commit_message>` with the commit message for the changes.

If you specify the branch name as `head`, the command will use `HEAD` to refer to the currently checked-out branch.

If the specified branch does not exist on the remote repository, the command will create a new branch and push changes to it.

### Admin Configuration

You can configure the GitHub access token and repository URL in the Magento admin panel under **Stores > Configuration > Ssquare > Github Settings**.
